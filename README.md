**Reading CSV File:**
Make sure that there is a folder called output_data. In that folder you will find:  
    1. cities.csv
    2. Fig1.png
    3. Fig2.png
    4. Fig3.png
    5. Fig4.png

The current files in those folders are the output from the program I ran. However, if you do run it again, all of them will be updated and written over.
